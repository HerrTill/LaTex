\subsection{Current situation}
An essential part of economic counselling is the assessment of allocated spending for different segments of a company. Spending of a firm usually is written down in invoice documents, which have to be grouped for segments to analyze their costs.
While the global market is estimated to comprise 550 billion invoices annually, 90\% are exchanged paper-based \cite{koch_e-invoicing_nodate}. With modern technology, these paper- or document based (PDF, docx, odt) files can be transformed into a structured or semi-structured format. According to expert estimates, unstructured data makes up for more than 80\% of enterprise data [2]. This data is not leverageable with traditional data analysis tools, but its value must be harvested for companies to utilize their full potential. A large share of unstructured data found in companies is textual data. \cite{turing_icomputing_1950}
