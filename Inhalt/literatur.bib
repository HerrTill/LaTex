We show that under a broad set of conditions (much broader than independent and identically distributed dimensions), as dimensionality increases, the distance to the nearest data point approaches the distance to the farthest data point. To provide a practical perspective, we present empirical results on both real and synthetic data sets that demonstrate that this effect can occur for as few as 10-15 dimensions.},

  abstract = {In recent years, research information systems (RIS) have become an integral part of the university’s IT landscape. At the same time, many universities and research institutions are still working on the implementation of such information systems. Research information systems support institutions in the measurement, documentation, evaluation and communication of research activities. Implementing such integrative systems requires that institutions assure the quality of the information on research activities entered into them. Since many information and data sources are interwoven, these different data sources can have a negative impact on data quality in different research information systems. Because the topic is currently of interest to many institutions, the aim of the present paper is firstly to consider how data quality can be investigated in the context of RIS, and then to explain how various dimensions of data quality described in the literature can be measured in research information systems. Finally, a framework as a process flow according to UML activity diagram notation is developed for monitoring and improvement of the quality of these data; this framework can be implemented by technical personnel in universities and research institutions.},

  abstract = {CRISP-DM(CRoss-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) has its origins in the second half of the nineties and is thus about two decades old. According to many surveys and user polls it is still the de facto standard for developing data mining and knowledge discovery projects. However, undoubtedly the field has moved on considerably in twenty years, with data science now the leading term being favoured over data mining. In this paper we investigate whether, and in what contexts, CRISP-DM is still fit for purpose for data science projects. We argue that if the project is goal-directed and process-driven the process model view still largely holds. On the other hand, when data science projects become more exploratory the paths that the project can take become more varied, and a more flexible model is called for. We suggest what the outlines of such a trajectory-based model might look like and how it can be used to categorise data science projects (goal-directed, exploratory or data management). We examine seven real-life exemplars where exploratory activities play an important role and compare them against 51 use cases extracted from the NIST Big Data Public Working Group. We anticipate this categorisation can help project planning in terms of time and cost characteristics.},
